# Advent of Code 2025

I use elixir for work, so I decided that I shall do this year's AOC in elixir.

I believe it was a very good decision on the part topaz as detailed in his [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/1ocwh04/changes_to_advent_of_code_starting_this_december/)
to remove the global leaderboard and make it for only 14 days.

It was generally that after the 18th day that the problems really increase in their difficulty, so I am pretty excited to see how the problem difficulty increases in 14 days.

It is a relief that there is no global leaderboard to tempt me, not that I was making it on there.

Let AOC this year be actually fun :)

## Setup

This is a simple elixir app.
